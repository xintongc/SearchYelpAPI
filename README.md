# Summary
The app is setup with Retrofit, a simple search API, and a couple of models with minimal fields.

The app retrieves data from the Yelp API and displays information about restaurants. Users can search location 
and terms on a search bar to get desired restaurants information.

## Getting Started
Replace `api-key-here` in `app/build.gradle` with your API Key generated from https://www.yelp.ca/developers/v3/manage_app

There is a simple test included in the `YelpTest.java` class that you may run to verify that your API key is working.
